  The Controls of a Plane
</h1>
<p>
  Every plane has the same basic controls just like cars do. Some minor controls vary depending on the production company of the plane. 
</p>
  <p>
    There are many different controls of a plane one of which being the stick. The stick sits in the middle of the seat and it controls the tilt and roll of the plane.The stick is connected to the ailerons. The stick also controls the elevators of the plane. The elevators control the pitch, which is whether the plane is descending or ascending. It controls the altitude of plane. when you pull back on the stick, it moves the elevators up to when the air hits it, it will move the nose of the plane upwards. If you push the stick forward, it will move the elevators down so the nose of the plane will move down towars the ground.

    Another control on a plane are the rudder pedals. Moving the rudders will enable you to turn in the air without having the plane to roll or tilt. The rudder is on the back of the tailfin on the plane. When you step on the right rudder pedal, it moves the ruder to right and the same for the left. When the air hits the rudder when it is not in resting position, it will move the plane in the direction that the tip of the ruddder is pointing. The rudder on a plane works the same way as the rudder on a ship does.  
  </p>
  The last basic control is the throttle. The throttle controls the speed of the engine. Some planes have jet engine, some have propellers, and some have a combination of both. For the planes with a jet engine, moving the throtte forward mixes more oxygen with the fuel to push the plane forward at a faster rate than before.
