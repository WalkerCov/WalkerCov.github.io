    How Planes Fly
  </h1>
  <p>
    Planes rely solely on their wings to fly. Without their wings they would not be able to even get off the ground. The wings have a very particular shape that use the direction of the air movement to create an upward force called lift that goes against gravity.
    The air will move over the wing hitting it at the break point of the wing. When the air hits the wing it will separate and go two different ways, on top and on bottom. The air pressure on the top of the wing decreases and the air pressure on the bottom increases. This creates a hard surface foor the wings to glide on.
